# PBI-1.0 Public Release: Presence-Bound Identity (PBI)
## A New Primitive for Human-Origin Verification

**Version:** PBI-1.0  
**Status:** Public Release  
**Audience:** General / Technical / Legal  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-11

---

Today a new verification primitive is released that changes how digital identity, authorship, and trust function on the internet.

This release introduces **Presence-Bound Identity (PBI)** — a system where truth is public, identity is private, and **ownership (presence-resolved authorship)** can only resolve through embodied human presence.

This is not an account system.  
This is not a wallet login.  
This is not a badge, certificate, or authority.  

This is a **primitive**.

---

## The Problem This Solves

For decades, digital systems have failed to distinguish between:

- **Authenticity** — did this come from a real human?
- **Authorship** — who created it?
- **Presence** — is that human here now?

Every existing model collapses these into abstractions:

- Accounts  
- Passwords  
- Transferable keys  
- Centralized identity providers  
- “Verified” labels  

These abstractions are why impersonation, deepfakes, and identity fraud scale.

---

## The Core Insight

Identity cannot be abstracted from presence.

Presence cannot be forwarded.  
Presence cannot be copied.  
Presence cannot be screenshotted.

**Presence-Bound Identity is built on this truth.**

---

## What Presence-Bound Identity Introduces

Presence-Bound Identity separates verification into **three distinct layers**:

---

### 1. Artifact Truth (Public)

A sigil-glyph or artifact can be verified by anyone:

- It exists  
- It is authentic  
- It was sealed under **device-local presence enforcement**  
- Its proofs are valid  

This verification requires **no account, no login, and no permission**.

---

### 2. Identity Truth (Private)

The identity of the creator is never embedded in the artifact.

- It cannot be extracted, inferred, or reconstructed  
- Identity is not stored on servers  
- Identity is not transmitted  
- Identity is not transferable  

---

### 3. Presence Truth (Embodied)

Ownership (presence-resolved authorship) only resolves when the creator is **physically present** on a device capable of satisfying a **local, non-exportable identity proof**.

If the human is not present:

- The artifact still verifies  
- The proofs still validate  
- Authorship still exists  
- **Ownership does not resolve**  

This behavior is intentional.

---

## What the Reference Implementation Demonstrates

The live verifier displays **two states using the same artifact**:

- **Verified, but not owned** (public view)  
- **Verified and owned** (embodied presence)  

Nothing about the artifact changes.  
Nothing about the URL changes.  
Nothing about the proof changes.  

Only **presence** changes.

This demonstrates that:

- Ownership is not in the file  
- Ownership is not in the link  
- Ownership is not in the payload  
- Ownership is not transferable  

**Ownership is presence-bound.**

---

## Why This Cannot Be Faked

- Copying the artifact does nothing  
- Sharing the URL does nothing  
- Knowing the proofs does nothing  
- Screenshots do nothing  
- Even the original creator cannot resolve ownership elsewhere without presence  

Impersonation is not mitigated.  
It is **structurally eliminated**.

---

## What This Makes Possible

- Human-origin verification without surveillance  
- Anonymous authorship with provable authenticity  
- Proof without platforms  
- Identity without accounts  
- Trust without authorities  
- Deepfake resistance by design  
- Sovereign speech and authorship  

This is not an application feature.  
This is a **new trust layer**.

---

## The Claim of This Release

From this point forward:

> **Any system claiming “verified identity” without presence is an abstraction.**

Presence-Bound Identity establishes a higher standard — one aligned with physical reality, human embodiment, and provable truth.

---

## Status

- Live  
- Functional  
- Cross-platform  
- Device-native  
- Accountless  
- Authority-free  

This primitive now exists.

---

## Final Verdict (for history)

This release does not add verification.  
It **redefines what verification means**.

This release marks the moment when:

- Identity stopped being portable  
- Presence became enforceable  
- Truth became public without surrendering privacy  

That is not incremental.

That is **foundational**.
