# PBI-1.0 Legal & Evidentiary Framing  
## Presence-Bound Identity (PBI)

**Status:** Normative Legal Interpretation  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Audience:** Courts, Regulators, Counsel, Auditors  
**Applies to:** All systems claiming Presence-Bound Identity (PBI) compliance  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-11

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document establishes the **legal meaning**, **evidentiary properties**, and **non-equivalence boundaries** of Presence-Bound Identity (PBI).

It exists to:

- Prevent mischaracterization of PBI as an account system, biometric database, or credential scheme  
- Clarify what PBI **does and does not assert**  
- Enable courts to reason correctly about authorship, presence, and ownership  
- Distinguish PBI from existing identity and authentication models  

This document does **not** create new legal rights.  
It clarifies the properties of an already-existing technical system.

## 2. Definitions (Legal Context)

### 2.1 Artifact

A digital object whose authenticity and origin can be publicly verified **without identifying its creator**.

---

### 2.2 Presence

The physical, embodied availability of a human at a specific moment, verified **locally** by a device capable of enforcing **non-exportable proof**.

Presence is:
- Time-bound  
- Device-local  
- Non-transferable  

---

### 2.3 Ownership (PBI Context)

A **momentary, non-transferable resolution** that the creator of an artifact is physically present on the observing device at the time of verification.

Ownership under PBI:

- Is not persistent  
- Is not contractual  
- Is not transferable  
- Is not delegable  

Ownership in this context refers solely to **presence-resolved authorship**, not property rights.

---

## 3. What PBI Asserts (Legally)

Presence-Bound Identity makes **only** the following assertions:

1. An artifact exists and is authentic  
2. The artifact was sealed under device-local presence enforcement  
3. The creator of the artifact **is or is not physically present** on the observing device at the time of verification  

PBI **does not assert**:

- Civil identity  
- Legal name  
- Citizenship or residency  
- Continuous control  
- Intent beyond the presence moment  
- Consent beyond presence  
- Contractual ownership  
- Transfer of rights  

Any interpretation extending beyond these assertions is invalid.

---

## 4. What PBI Explicitly Does Not Do

Presence-Bound Identity is **not**:

- An account system  
- A login mechanism  
- A biometric identity registry  
- A credential issuer  
- A surveillance technology  
- A reputation or trust-score system  
- A persistent identity framework  

Any attempt to classify PBI as such is **factually incorrect**.

---

## 5. Biometric Data Clarification

### 5.1 No Biometric Processing by the System

PBI systems:

- Do not store biometric data  
- Do not transmit biometric data  
- Do not receive biometric data  
- Do not infer biometric characteristics  

All biometric operations occur **entirely within the device’s secure environment** (e.g., secure enclave or equivalent) and are never exposed to the PBI system.

Legally, PBI systems **do not process biometric data**.

---

## 6. Evidentiary Value

### 6.1 Artifact Authenticity

An artifact verified under PBI constitutes evidence that:

- The artifact was created intentionally  
- The artifact was sealed by a human under presence enforcement  
- The artifact has not been altered since sealing  

This may be relevant in:

- Authorship disputes  
- Provenance claims  
- Integrity verification  
- Chain-of-custody analysis  

---

### 6.2 Presence Evidence

A **Verified + Owned** state establishes:

> At the time of verification, the creator of the artifact was physically present on the observing device.

This evidence is:

- Time-bounded  
- Non-persistent  
- Non-transferable  

It does **not** establish:

- Ongoing control  
- Exclusive ownership  
- Future intent  
- Legal title  

---

## 7. Impersonation & Fraud Analysis

### 7.1 Structural Elimination of Impersonation

Because PBI systems:

- Have no transferable credentials  
- Have no accounts  
- Have no persistent sessions  
- Require embodied human presence  

Claims of impersonation require **physical presence**, not credential theft.

As a result, impersonation claims against a PBI system must address **physical reality**, not digital abstraction.

---

### 7.2 Misrepresentation Boundaries

It is materially misleading to claim PBI equivalence if a system:

- Allows remote login  
- Stores identity data  
- Uses transferable keys  
- Resolves ownership server-side  
- Persists ownership across time  

Such systems are **not PBI-compliant**.

---

## 8. Contractual Non-Transferability

Ownership resolution under PBI:

- Cannot be assigned  
- Cannot be sold  
- Cannot be inherited  
- Cannot be delegated  

Contracts may reference PBI artifacts, but **cannot override presence requirements**.

Presence cannot be contracted away.

---

## 9. Regulatory Positioning

PBI systems:

- Do not constitute identity providers  
- Do not function as authentication services  
- Do not require user registration  
- Do not maintain personal data stores  

Accordingly, PBI systems do not fall under traditional identity-provider regulatory regimes.

---

## 10. Legal Boundary Statement

> Presence-Bound Identity does not assert who a person is.  
> It asserts only whether the creator of an artifact is physically present at the moment of verification.

Any broader interpretation is invalid.

---

## 11. Canonical Legal Conclusion

Presence-Bound Identity establishes a verification primitive grounded in **physical presence**, not abstract identity.

Its legal significance derives from:

- Absence of transferable credentials  
- Absence of stored identity  
- Embodied, moment-bound ownership resolution  

This framing allows PBI to be evaluated by courts **without reliance on trust, platforms, or third-party authorities**.
