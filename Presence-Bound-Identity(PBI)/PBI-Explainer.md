# Presence-Bound Identity (PBI)  
## A Plain-Language Explanation

**Version:** PBI-1.0  
**Audience:** General Public, Creators, Builders, Journalists  
**Purpose:** Explain PBI clearly without redefining or weakening it

---

## What this is — in simple terms

Presence-Bound Identity (PBI) is a new way to verify:

- that something is real,  
- that it was made by a human, and  
- whether that human is actually **here right now**.

It does this **without** accounts, passwords, platforms, wallets, or surveillance.

---

## The core problem PBI solves

Most systems today cannot tell the difference between:

- a real human, and  
- a copied credential.

They verify **accounts**, **keys**, or **badges** — not people.

That works until:
- passwords leak,
- keys are copied,
- images and videos are faked,
- voices are cloned,
- AI can convincingly impersonate anyone.

At that point, “verification” stops meaning anything.

---

## The key insight behind PBI

There is one thing that cannot be copied or forwarded:

> **Physical presence.**

You can copy a file.  
You can steal a password.  
You can replay a key.  
You can fake an image or a voice.

But you cannot be **physically present somewhere you are not**.

PBI treats **presence** as the foundation of verification.

---

## Three things PBI separates (that used to be mixed)

Most systems mix these together.  
PBI separates them.

### 1. Truth  
Is this artifact real and unaltered?

### 2. Identity  
Who made it?

### 3. Presence  
Is that person here right now?

Separating these turns out to solve the problem.

---

## How PBI works (no technical jargon)

### Anyone can verify the artifact

If someone shares a sigil, glyph, or artifact:

- Anyone can check that it’s authentic  
- Anyone can confirm it hasn’t been changed  
- Anyone can verify it was sealed by a human  

No login.  
No account.  
No permission.

That is **public truth**.

---

### The creator’s identity stays private

The artifact does **not** contain:

- a name  
- an account  
- personal data  
- biometric data  

There is no hidden profile attached.

You can know it was made by a human  
without knowing who that human is.

That is **private identity**.

---

### Ownership only appears if the creator is present

If the creator opens the same artifact on their own device:

- the device can check whether that human is physically there,  
- this happens locally on the device,  
- nothing is sent to a server,  
- nothing is stored.

If the human is present, the system shows:

**Verified + Owned**

If not, it shows:

**Verified (but not owned)**

The artifact does not change.  
The link does not change.  
Only **presence** changes.

That is **embodied verification**.

---

## Why copying does not work

If someone else:

- copies the file,  
- shares the link,  
- screenshots it,  
- knows all the proof data,

they still cannot claim ownership.

Why?

Because ownership is **not in the file**.  
It is **not on a server**.  
It is **not transferable**.

Ownership only resolves when the creator is physically present.

---

## What PBI makes possible

- Proving something is human-made without revealing identity  
- Anonymous authorship with verifiable authenticity  
- Verification without platforms or permission  
- Identity without accounts  
- Trust without central authorities  
- Resistance to deepfakes by design  
- Sovereign speech and authorship  

This is not an app feature.

It is a **new trust layer**.

---

## What PBI is not

Presence-Bound Identity is **not**:

- a login system  
- a wallet  
- a biometric database  
- a social network  
- a reputation score  
- a “verified badge”  

There are no accounts.  
There is no central authority.  
There is nothing to steal.

---

## Why this matters now

As AI-generated content becomes indistinguishable from human-made content, the important question is no longer:

> “Is this impressive?”

The important question is:

> **“Did a real human actually make this?”**

Presence-Bound Identity answers that question  
without surveillance, profiling, or control.

---

## The simplest way to remember it

- **Truth is public**  
- **Identity is private**  
- **Ownership is physical**  

If the human is here, ownership resolves.  
If not, it doesn’t.

That’s the whole system.

---

## Final takeaway

Presence-Bound Identity does not try to guess who someone is.

It answers a simpler, more honest question:

> **Is the human who made this actually here — right now?**

That turns out to be enough.
